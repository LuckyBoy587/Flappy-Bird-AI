## 📝 MODIFIED FILES (1 file)

1. **`bird_ai.py`** (was 134 lines → now 299 lines)
   - ✅ Added: `train_dqn_vectorized()` function
   - ✅ Added: Multi-bird configuration parameters
   - ✅ Kept: Original `train_dqn()` unchanged (backward compatible)
   - ✅ Added: Import for `VectorFlappyBirdEnv`

---

## 🚀 HOW TO USE IT

### EASIEST WAY (Recommended for You!)
```bash
python main.py
```
Then:
1. Choose option **2** (Multi-Bird Training)
2. Enter **16** for number of birds
3. Enter **n** for no rendering (faster)
4. Press Enter and watch it train!

### ALTERNATIVE WAYS

**In Python code:**
```python
from bird_ai import train_dqn_vectorized

# Train with 16 birds
model = train_dqn_vectorized(num_envs=16, render_first=False)
```

**Quick demo:**
```bash
python demo_multi_bird.py
```

## 📊 BEFORE vs AFTER

### BEFORE (Your Original Setup)
```
Single bird trains for 2000 episodes
├─ One bird per episode
├─ ~500 steps per episode
├─ Total: 1,000,000 training steps
└─ Takes: ~2-3 hours
```

### AFTER (New Multi-Bird Training)
```
16 birds train together for 2000 episodes
├─ 16 birds per episode (parallel)
├─ ~500 steps per bird per episode
├─ Total: 16,000,000 training steps
└─ Still takes: ~2-3 hours (same time!)

Result: 16x more experience in the same time! 🚀
```

   - Adjust based on your hardware
   - Scale up or down easily

5. **Safe**
   - Your original code still works
   - Can switch back anytime
   - No breaking changes

## 🎮 TRAINING OUTPUT

You'll see this during training:

```
Episode    1/2000 | Avg Reward:  -85.23 | Max:   12.50 | Min: -100.00 | Epsilon: 0.995
Episode    2/2000 | Avg Reward:  -72.45 | Max:   45.20 | Min: -100.00 | Epsilon: 0.990
Episode   50/2000 | Avg Reward:   34.56 | Max:  178.90 | Min:   -5.20 | Epsilon: 0.778
  → Checkpoint saved: dqn_flappy_bird_ep50.pth
  → Last 50 episodes avg: 23.45
...
Episode 2000/2000 | Avg Reward:  245.67 | Max:  389.20 | Min:  156.30 | Epsilon: 0.010

Training completed!
Final model saved to dqn_flappy_bird.pth
Best model saved to dqn_flappy_bird_best.pth
```

---

## 💾 WHAT GETS SAVED

After training, you'll have:

```
dqn_flappy_bird.pth          ← Final trained model
dqn_flappy_bird_best.pth     ← Best model during training
dqn_flappy_bird_ep50.pth     ← Checkpoint at episode 50
dqn_flappy_bird_ep100.pth    ← Checkpoint at episode 100
dqn_flappy_bird_ep150.pth    ← Checkpoint at episode 150
... (every 50 episodes)
```

---

## 🧪 TESTING YOUR TRAINED MODEL

After training, test it:

```bash
python main.py
```
Choose option **3** (Test Trained Model)

Or in Python:
```python
from main import test_trained_model

test_trained_model("dqn_flappy_bird_best.pth", num_episodes=10)
```

---

## ⚙️ CUSTOMIZATION

Want to change settings? Edit `bird_ai.py`:

```python
# Change number of birds (line 19)
num_birds = 32  # Use more birds (default: 16)

# Change training duration (line 18)
episodes = 3000  # Train longer (default: 2000)

# Change learning rate (line 17)
lr = 0.0005  # Slower learning (default: 0.001)
```
