# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This document explains how the Flappy Bird AI project is deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Overview

The project is deployed to GitHub Pages at: https://luckyboy587.github.io/Flappy-Bird-AI/

The deployment creates a professional landing page that showcases the project, provides documentation, and links to the repository.

## Deployment Architecture

### Static Website
Since this is a Python/Pygame application that cannot run directly in a browser, we've created a static HTML landing page that:
- Provides comprehensive project documentation
- Showcases features and capabilities
- Provides installation and usage instructions
- Links to the GitHub repository for downloads

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The deployment is automated using GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
- **Trigger**: Automatically runs on push to `main` or `master` branch
- **Manual Trigger**: Can be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch
- **Process**:
  1. Checks out the repository
  2. Configures GitHub Pages
  3. Uploads the site content
  4. Deploys to GitHub Pages

## Files

### Landing Page
- **File**: `index.html`
- **Purpose**: Professional landing page with project information
- **Features**:
  - Responsive design
  - Feature highlights
  - Installation guide
  - Quick start instructions
  - Technical documentation
  - Links to repository

### Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Purpose**: Automated deployment pipeline
- **Actions Used**:
  - `actions/checkout@v4` - Checkout repository
  - `actions/configure-pages@v4` - Configure GitHub Pages
  - `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` - Upload site content
  - `actions/deploy-pages@v4` - Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
To enable GitHub Pages for this repository:

1. Go to repository **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Pages** section (under "Code and automation")
3. Under **Source**, select "GitHub Actions"
4. Save the settings

### 2. Trigger Deployment
The deployment will trigger automatically when:
- Code is pushed to the `main` or `master` branch
- Manually triggered from the Actions tab

### 3. Verify Deployment
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in the repository
2. Check the latest "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow run
3. Once completed, visit: https://luckyboy587.github.io/Flappy-Bird-AI/

## Updating the Website

To update the website content:

1. Edit `index.html` in the repository
2. Commit and push changes to `main` or `master`
3. GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild and deploy

## Permissions Required

The workflow requires the following permissions (already configured):
- `contents: read` - To read repository content
- `pages: write` - To deploy to GitHub Pages
- `id-token: write` - For deployment authentication

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Pygbag (Not Used)
Initially considered using Pygbag to convert the Pygame application to WebAssembly for browser execution. However, this approach was not pursued because:
- Complex setup with dependencies (especially PyTorch)
- Limited browser compatibility
- Performance concerns
- Maintenance overhead

The static landing page approach provides better user experience and easier maintenance.

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Ensure workflow has proper permissions

### Site Not Updating
1. Check if workflow completed successfully
2. GitHub Pages may cache content - wait a few minutes
3. Try force refresh in browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### 404 Error
1. Verify repository name is correct in the URL
2. Ensure GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. Check that `index.html` exists in the root directory

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the deployment:
- Add demo videos or GIFs
- Create interactive JavaScript visualizations
- Add training progress charts
- Include pre-trained model download links
- Add blog posts about AI training results
